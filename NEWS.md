# User visible changes in `FITSHeaders` package

# Version 0.4.2

- Lowercase letters are allowed in `HIERARCH` tokens.

# Version 0.4.1

- Update compatibility for `TypeUtils`.

# Version 0.4.0

- Package renamed as `FITSHeaders`.

- Undefined FITS card value is `undef` (was `missing`). When creating a FITS
  card, `missing` is considered as `undef`.

- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `≤`, and `≥`) can be applied to
  FITS card values. The other operand may also be a card value.

- Logical value stored as an integer in `FitsCard`. This is an internal change.

# Version 0.3.11

- Update doc.

- Submitted as an official Julia package.

## Version 0.3.10

- Extend `haskey` for `FitsHeader` objects.

## Version 0.3.9

- `"TFIELDS"`, `"TFORM#"`, `"TTYPE#"`, and `"TDIM#"` are also structural keywords.

## Version 0.3.8

- New non-exported methods: `BaseFITS.is_structural` and `BaseFITS.is_naxis`
  to respectively check whether a FITS card or keyword is a structural or axis
  one.

## Version 0.3.7

- Package `AsType` is now [`TypeUtils`](https://github.com/emmt/TypeUtils.jl).

## Version 0.3.6

- Package is compatible with Julia 1.0.

- Avoid returning number of bytes written in `show`.

- Date-time format is ISO-8601 as specified by FITS standard.

## Version 0.3.5

- Fix creating FITS cards from pairs of type `Pair{<:CardName,<:Any}` which may
  be the type of the objects in some collections, such as vectors, used to
  represent FITS header. Non-exported `BaseFITS.CardPair{K<:CardName,V}` is an
  alias for such pair types.

## Version 0.3.4

- *Provide support for dates:* Card values of type `Dates.DateTime` are
  automatically converted into string values and, conversely, calling
  `card.value(DateTime)`, `convert(DataTime,card.value)`, and
  `DateTime(card.value)` attempts to convert the string value of `card` into a
  date.

## Version 0.3.3

- Use `AsType` package.

- Remove `CompatHelper`.

## Version 0.3.2

- Fix silly bug in keyword comparison.

## Version 0.3.1

- Use quick table for character class.

## Version 0.3.0

- Package renamed `BaseFITS.jl`.

- `FitsHeader` can be built from list of header cards, list of pairs, and named
  tuples. Here "list" means any iterable producing items of a given type. The
  same types are allowed for `merge` and `merge!` applied to a FITS header.

- Non-exported constants `CarName`, `CardValue`, `CardComment`, and `Undefined`
  to help converting a pair into a FITS header card.

- `BaseFITS.keyword` and `BaseFITS.check_keyword` can take a symbolic name as
  argument.

## Version 0.2.1

- Can search cards in FITS header by regular expressions.
- Implement merging of headers with `merge` and `merge!`.
- `length(eachmatch(pat,hdr::FitsHeader))` yields number of matches.
- Some bug fixes.

## Version 0.2.0

- Package renamed `FITSBase.jl`.
- To avoid collisions with `FITSIO.jl` types are prefixed by `Fits` instead of
  `FITS`.

## Version 0.1.1

- Package name `FITSCards.jl`.
- Add `FITSHeader` structure.
- New card properties: `card.units` and `card.unitless`.
